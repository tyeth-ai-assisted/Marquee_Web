/**
 * Creating — and, when a display is removed, deleting — the device's Adafruit IO group
 * and feeds: the write half of the IO integration. A5b creates; removeDevice() deletes.
 *
 * Separate from feeds.js, which is the READ half: that module pulls Konva in for
 * the element picker, and a setup screen that runs before the editor exists has no
 * business loading the editor. This one imports api.js and nothing else.
 *
 * It also keeps a different error contract, deliberately. feeds.js swallows failures
 * and returns null, which is right when null means "we don't know what that feed
 * says". It is useless here: a provisioning step has to tell a bad key from a plan
 * limit from a flaky network, because the three want three different things from the
 * user. So every call below resolves to a tagged result and never throws.
 *
 * THE KEY IS A HEADER, ALWAYS. Never a query string, never a log line, never a
 * toast — see the note on ioFetch().

 * order the dots light up in, and bitmap — the one the board cannot run without —
 * goes first so a run that dies halfway leaves the most useful feed behind.
 *
 * HISTORY IS NOT A PREFERENCE. Adafruit IO caps a datum at 1 KB on a feed with
 * history on and 512 KB with it off (IO_MAX_HISTORY / IO_MAX_NO_HISTORY in api.js).
 * A packed panel is ~20 KB, so the bitmap feed is not merely better off without
 * history — it is unusable with it, and IO rejects the publish outright. The sleep
 * and status feeds carry small JSON payloads and want their history: device.js
 * reads the status feed as a BATCH of recent data points to reconstruct wakes it slept
 * through, and a history-off feed retains none to read. canvas-state sits with bitmap
 * on the other side of the line — it is a whole document, images and all.
