/**
 * A5b — configure Adafruit IO.
 *
 * Sits where it does because it has to: the device is flashed two steps from here with
 * the username, the key and the three feed keys baked in, and until this screen has run
 * those keys are a guess. A board booting on a guessed feed key fetches nothing and
 * draws nothing, and there is no error anywhere to tell you why — which is the failure
 * this screen exists to prevent.
 *
 * ONE field and one action, and the screen is built to look like it. The Adafruit IO
 * account is not asked for here — it was settled once in A1-C, before the first display
 * was ever added, and this screen reads it (see the plate at the top). The device name
 * becomes the group's name, its slug becomes the group key, and it is also what this
 * display is called everywhere else in the app — the tile on A1, the crumb in the
 * chrome. The feeds box below is a preview of what will be created, and then the
 * progress display for creating it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCREEN SAYS, IT SAYS IN THE RAIL. The main column is the account, the field,
 * the four dots and the buttons; every standing explanation is in the aside. The group
 * key line is the exception, and only because it is a readout of what was typed rather
 * than prose: "Kitchen Board" creating `kitchen-board` is a consequence the user should
 * meet here rather than in the IO web UI afterwards.
 *
 * REUSE OVER REPLACE, always. An existing group is used as it stands and an existing
 * feed is left alone — this screen never renames or deletes anything on the account.
